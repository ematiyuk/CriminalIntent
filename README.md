# CriminalIntent

CriminalIntent records the details of "office crimes" â€“ things like leaving dirty dishes in the breakroom sink or walking away from an empty shared printer after your documents have printed.

With CriminalIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook, or other app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.
